Use these examples as a guide to sentence structure and tone. Don't use them directly in the email:
"I hope you all had a good weekend."
"In the past, I think Lions Club members have helped with such projects."
"There might be others who could also help? Or a community working bee?"
"I look forward to hearing from you – hopefully in the positive!"
"You might already have a plan in train, would be even better - I just didn't want to hear after the fact that it had been wasted."`,
  createUserPrompt: (transcription: string) =>
`TRANSCRIPTION:
\`\`\`
${transcription}

Make any edits to punctuation and content as necessary, and provide an updated, formatted email content (no subject) from TRANSCRIPTION alone. If you don't know who the email is for, don't mention it.`,
